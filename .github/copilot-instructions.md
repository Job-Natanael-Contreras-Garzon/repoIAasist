<!-- Use this file to provide workspace-specific custom instructions to Copilot. For more details, visit https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-a-githubcopilotinstructionsmd-file -->

## Project Overview
This is a React Native emergency medical assistance application that provides AI-powered voice-guided first aid instructions during medical emergencies.

## Key Features
- Voice-guided first aid instructions using AI (Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text)
- Emergency categories selection with visual cards
- Firebase integration for user authentication and data storage
- Emergency calling functionality (110 for Bolivia)
- Offline mode capabilities for basic first aid guidance
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React Native with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore, Authentication, Cloud Functions)
- **AI Integration**: External API for voice interactions (Google Cloud Speech-to-Text/Text-to-Speech)
- **Voice Processing**: React Native Voice, React Native TTS
- **UI Components**: React Native Elements or Native Base
- **Navigation**: React Navigation
- **State Management**: Context API or Redux Toolkit

## Project Structure
- `src/screens/`: All screen components
- `src/components/`: Reusable UI components
- `src/services/`: API services, Firebase config, AI voice services
- `src/utils/`: Utility functions and helpers
- `src/models/`: TypeScript interfaces and types
- `src/assets/`: Images, icons, and other static assets
- `src/navigation/`: Navigation configuration

## Development Guidelines
1. Use TypeScript for all components and services
2. Follow React Native best practices for performance
3. Implement proper error handling for voice recognition and emergency calls
4. Ensure accessibility features are included
5. Test on both Android and iOS platforms
6. Use proper permissions handling for microphone and phone access
7. Implement offline functionality for critical features

## Emergency Categories
- Cortes y Heridas (Cuts and Wounds)
- Quemaduras (Burns)
- Insolaci√≥n (Heatstroke)
- Atragantamiento (Choking)
- Desmayo (Fainting)
- RCP (CPR)

## Voice Interaction Flow
1. User selects emergency category or uses voice activation
2. AI asks for more details about the emergency
3. User responds via voice input
4. AI provides step-by-step first aid instructions
5. Option to call emergency services (110) at any time

## Firebase Services
- **Authentication**: User registration and login
- **Firestore**: Store emergency data, user preferences, and interaction history
- **Cloud Functions**: Handle AI API calls and complex business logic
- **Storage**: Store offline first aid guides and media assets
